# qgrep (Quick Grep)
Super fast full text grep for programmers

-----------------------
## NEWS!
qgrep is now free and can be found on [github](https://github.com/Bradbev/qgrep) under a BSD license.

## Introduction 
Programmers commonly need to search code, faster searching makes for
increased productivity. qgrep can be significantly faster than search 
tools that don't build a database and is very easy to setup - simple
projects need only a couple of lines of configuration.  
qgrep runs on OS X and Windows, with a Linux port coming soon.

## Installation 

### OSX
[Download](http://www.qgrep.com/qgrep-osx.tgz) and extract to a directory of your choice.  
Currently qgrep runs on OSX 10.5 or later on a 64bit Intel system.

### Linux 
Coming soon, please email <brad@qgrep.com> to express your
interest.

### Windows 
[Download](http://www.qgrep.com/setup.exe) and run the Windows installer.

## Configuration and Usage 
qgrep expects to find a configuration file in a specific place.  For
*nix systems the file is `~/.qgrep/projects.lua`

For Windows the file is `$(HOME)/.qgrep/projects.lua` if it exists, or
`$(HOMEDRIVE)$(HOMEPATH)/.qgrep/projects.lua` otherwise.

If the projects.lua file cannot be found, qgrep will offer to create
the expected directory and config file. A large part of qgrep's
functionality is written in Lua, and Lua is also used for project
configuration.  Every qgrep command except **search** results in the
`projects.lua` file being executed.  The full Lua language is able to
be used from `projects.lua`, though it should be kept simple.  The
**search** command is intended to be as fast as possible (the whole
point of qgrep!), and will run without interpreting the `projects.lua`
file. 

### Example projects.lua file

    Project{"linux", 
        track("~/source/linux-2.6", "\\.c$", "\\.h$"),
        ignore("f.o", "^bar\\.c$") 
    }

**Project** is a Lua function that accepts a table as its only
  argument, the table should be a comma seperated list within {}.
  The first element in the table *must* be a string and is used to
  name the project, "linux" in our example case.  There can be any
  number of **track** or **ignore** entries after the name of the
  project.

**track(path, patterns...)** tells qgrep to add *path* to the project,
  and will recursively add all subdirectories.  *patterns* is a list
  of regular expression patterns, any files under path that match any
  pattern will be added.  In the example, we wish to add any file that
  ends in '.c' or '.h'.  You can have any number of patterns after the
  path entry. Having no patterns will result in all files being
  added.  Because the project file is just Lua code, backslashes must
  be escaped.  In the above example `\\.c` becomes the regex `\.c`, so
  that `.` will be matched as the period character rather than the
  usual regex meaning of ". means match any character"

**ignore(patterns...)** tells qgrep to ignore files that match any
  pattern.  There can be multiple ignore entries.  In our example, any
  filename that contains the pattern "f.o" will be ignored.  Also any
  file that is exactly named "bar.c" will be ignored.  The exactness
  is because the pattern is surrounded by `^` and `$`.  The second
  ignore pattern will never be matched because filenames are tested
  with their full path, ie all files will start with
  `~/source/linux-2.6/` 

## Benchmarks 
Benchmarks are a funny thing at the best of times, and even more so when you 
add in the filesystem caching layer.  I have tested OSX and Windows with
both hot and cold caches.  qgrep performs about the same with either a 
hot or cold cache.  find/grep performs much better with a hot cache, and
on OSX can actually do better than qgrep.  qgrep on Windows is always faster
than Cygwin's find/grep.  qgrep will function best in an environment that 
often has a cold cache.  My personal use case is 8 million lines of code
on a Windows machine that often runs a high IO load under heavy memory pressure.
The IO and memory pressure comes from compiling those 8 million lines!
qgrep runs very well in that scenario, still being able to search quickly while
compiling and linking.
The benchmarks show searching all source & header files in linux-2.6, 26000 
files in almost 10 million lines of code.

### Windows
The first three benchmarks show find/grep and the impact of Windows' file
caching layer.

    $ time find . -iname "*.[ch]" -print0 | xargs -0 grep NotFound_
    real    2m57.219s
    user    0m6.922s
    sys     0m14.192s

    $ time find . -iname "*.[ch]" -print0 | xargs -0 grep NotFound_
    real    0m10.985s
    user    0m6.395s
    sys     0m10.979s

    $ time find . -iname "*.[ch]" -print0 | xargs -0 grep NotFound_
    real    0m11.078s
    user    0m6.704s
    sys     0m10.773s
    
qgrep is much faster in both the hot and cold cache case.    

    $ time qgrep.exe search linux NotFound_
    real    0m5.485s
    user    0m0.015s
    sys     0m0.015s

    $ time qgrep.exe search linux NotFound_
    real    0m2.453s
    user    0m0.015s
    sys     0m0.000s

### OS X
The first run is with cold file caches, the next two runs show that OS X 
does a good job with file caching.  With hot caches, find/grep beats qgrep!

    $ time find . -iname "*.[ch]" -print0 | xargs -0 grep NotFound_
    real	0m25.590s
    user	0m0.862s
    sys	0m3.742s

    $ time find . -iname "*.[ch]" -print0 | xargs -0 grep NotFound_
    real	0m7.667s
    user	0m0.674s
    sys	0m1.151s

    $ time find . -iname "*.[ch]" -print0 | xargs -0 grep NotFound_
    real	0m1.211s
    user	0m0.627s
    sys	0m0.593s

qgrep runs in the same amount of time with hot or cold file system caches.
    
    $ time qgrep search linux NotFound_
    real 0m2.211s 
    user 0m3.035s 
    sys 0m0.142s 
       
## Etc
qgrep was written by Brad Beveridge, if you find qgrep to be useful a
donation would be excellent motivation for me to make further
improvements (such as much improved multicore support!). If total
donations exceed $1000 Canadian dollars, I will release qgrep under a
permissive licence like BSD.
