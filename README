Qgrep is very similar to grep, but faster.  It is faster because it
builds a database of the target search corpus.  The database is simply
a zip file, but works well due to text generally compressing very
well.  Compression is important because it reduces the IO load from
physical hardware.

I originally started Qgrep with the hope of making a little bit of
cash out of it, sadly that has not happened (I'm probably not good at
marketing!) so I am releasing Qgrep under the BSD license.

Enjoy!
